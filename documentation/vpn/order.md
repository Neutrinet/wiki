# 0. Where to start ?

- here : https://vpn.neutrinet.be

# 1. Email

Use one of your email address.
If you do not use a «real email», your only way to retieve the certificates you need for the VPN is by login on https://user.neutrinet.be AFTER the complete process.
- it will be used as your login for the vpn
- it will be also used as your login for https://user.neutrinet.be/
- it will be used as the email where your download link will be sent.

# 3. Identification method
In theory you can use your BeID and you your Belgian Citizen private key.
I never tried, so [use a password].

If you want to use your BeID, please have a look [here](https://eid.belgium.be/en) first.

# 4. Without BeID ... manual registration

Provide your details.

**Reminder**, we provide a encrypted transporting service behind a fixed IP not a total anonymizer package... so you should be ... you.

# 6. Keypair generation

**Reminder**, we provide a encrypted transporting service behind a fixed IP not a total anonymizer package... so your IP, your responsability!

- create and open a folder to contain those important files for your vpn
- generate your keypair and CSR as explained on the website
  - you are generating your private and public keys,
  - the details can or cannot represents you
  - please consider that the FQDN and EMAIL can be the same as your login email (step 1), it would be easier for us to assist you in case of need.
  - do NOT use a challenge password

# 7. Almost here!

- turn on IPv4 (if you need an IP v4) and it will provide you YOUR fixed IP.
- IPv6 is generated automalically and will be provided by the VPN connexion. 
- do not worry about the «review your information field»
- check the «Stuff for nerdz» it's important to recieve an email WITH the right link to download you vpn certificate. (because the registration is «buggy» and a newer version is under dev).
