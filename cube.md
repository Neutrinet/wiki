# English

Objective: providing the possibility for our (future) members to end up in a possession of a running Internet Cube and try to keep this state as long as the member wants it (aka "support")
Needed knowledge: about half of the job is stock management (handling orders, ordering, assembling packs), so no absolutly needed knowledge
Good to have knowledge:

* how to talk about the project, answering common questions
* for installation: linux sysadmin skill (basic, like using a shell + finding a device on a network)
* know the common bugs and how to fix it or who to reach
* for backoffice developpement python/django

## Active people

* Sombrefay - installation, logistic
* Bram - coordinator]/logistic, support
* Thomas - installation
* Quentin - support
* Denis - 3rd sunday
* Tharyrok - support

## Activities

Group orders
* collecting it and answering to questions on cube.neutrinet.be
* making sure that questions
* actually make the order (it more complicated than expected)
* receiving the order (thanks modern delivery societies, this isn't has obvious has it can be sometime ...)
	* possibility to receive cube at Denis place
* assembling packs

Communication
* information people that their order is here and how they can get it
* send reminder regarding this

Cube installation
* generating certificats for everyone (python script, can be touchy)
* meeting with the member, either at 123 or at your place (like kload or sombrefay) and make the installation, this include quite a lot of discussion and explanation while the installation part should be working out of the box
* debugging if needed ...
* mount hdd to boot : http://neutrinet.be/index.php?title=Mount_brique

Support
* answer to emails
* communicate with yunohost dev team and put bugs on dev.yunohost.org if needed
* be there during the 3rd sunday of the month at 123 rue royale for support
* share knowledge of how you've fixed stuff

## Current things to do

[dev] put a link in https://cube.neutrinet.be/admin to admin2 using django-admin-views
[dev] Tharyrok : Hypercube by neutrinet -> detail on the mailing
make a summary of our current cube situation
* check who has paid
* remind people that don't have them that their cube is waiting for them
* since we were so slow we probably lost interest of some people in the mean time :( (haven't paid and won't)
explore a solution to avoid this awefully long delay for cube ordering
Tharyrok/Bram: fix http://support.neutrinet.be (switch to OsTicket)
on admin2 of cube.neutrinet.be
* list every perso that still needs to get their cube
* same for paying
* with emails list and so one

* integrate hypercube in cube.neutrinet.be to make installation way easier
* currently our ordering situation is bad and this create huge delay which sucks
* having a stock or ready hardware
